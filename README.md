<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I love the outdoors, and love road trips, and while there are tons of sites out there for camping, what I need is a motivating and helpful itinerary builder to go to said campsites. 

Along The Rocky Road is a solo React app that enables users to plan ideas for a road trip along the Rocky Mountain range in Colorado, Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana. The data is sourced from Rec.gov's API. Each location page features a background image of that location, with helpful information about the site. 

Users can search places along the Rocky Mountain Range, explore the photo gallery, add a new itinerary or add a location to an existing itinerary, and learn information about a selected site. The site gives a 98% or higher Accessibility rating, passes all tests in Jest and includes testing for edge cases. 


### Built With

- React 
- SCSS
